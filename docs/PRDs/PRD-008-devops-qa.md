# PRD-008 — DevOps & QA Foundations

## Context
The repository lacks continuous integration pipelines, automated testing enforcement, and observability tooling. To support rapid iteration across marketing, builder, runtime, and backend, we need a reliable DevOps foundation covering CI/CD, environment management, and monitoring.

## Objectives & Success Metrics
- Establish CI pipelines that run lint, type checks, tests, and build steps on every pull request with <10 minute duration.
- Automate deployments to staging and production with rollback capabilities.
- Implement observability stack (logging, error tracking, uptime monitoring) achieving MTTR under 1 hour for critical incidents.

## Personas & User Stories
- **Developer**: Wants fast feedback on code quality and confidence that deployments are consistent.
- **Release manager**: Needs visibility into deployment status and ability to promote builds.
- **Support/ops**: Requires monitoring, alerts, and runbooks to handle incidents quickly.

### Core User Stories
1. As a developer, every PR triggers lint, tests, and build checks, blocking merge on failure.
2. As a release manager, I can deploy to staging automatically on merge to `main` and promote to production via approval.
3. As support, I receive alerts when errors spike or uptime checks fail and can consult logs and runbooks.

## Scope
- GitHub Actions workflows:
  - `ci.yml`: installs dependencies, runs lint (`pnpm lint`), type check (`pnpm typecheck`), unit tests (`pnpm test`), and build (`pnpm build`).
  - `e2e.yml`: optional nightly workflow executing Playwright tests against staging.
  - `deploy.yml`: on push to `main`, deploys web app to Vercel, API to Render/Fly.io, and runs Supabase migrations.
- Environment configuration with `.env.example` updates, secret management guidelines, and staging/prod separation.
- QA checklist template and automated regression test suite (unit + integration) coverage goals (>80%).
- Observability setup: Sentry for errors, Logflare/Logtail for logs, uptime checks via Better Stack or similar.
- Runbooks stored in `docs/runbooks/` covering deployment, incident response, and rollback steps.

## Out of Scope
- Full infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) (future ops iteration).
- Load testing automation (captured under performance PRD later).

## UX & Content Requirements
- Provide developer documentation for pipelines, environment setup, and troubleshooting.
- Dashboard widgets in back-office for system status (future enhancement, not required now).

## Technical Requirements
- Use pnpm caching strategies in GitHub Actions for fast builds.
- Configure matrix runs for frontend/backend tests if runtime differs.
- Integrate Supabase CLI for migrations during CI and CD.
- Setup Sentry DSNs, log ingestion endpoints, and alert routing (PagerDuty/Slack).
- Define environment promotion workflow (staging → production) with manual approval step.
- Add status badges for CI workflows in README.

## Dependencies
- Secrets for Vercel, Render/Fly.io, Supabase, Sentry, Stripe (from PRD-007), etc.
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright) configured in repository.
- Collaboration with infra/security teams for alert policies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI workflows run automatically and fail appropriately on lint/test/build issues.
- [ ] Deploy pipeline updates staging automatically and provides manual promotion to production.
- [ ] Observability tools capture errors/logs and emit alerts based on thresholds.
- [ ] Documentation exists for developers and ops covering CI/CD and incident response.
- [ ] Test coverage metrics collected and reported in CI.

## Instrumentation
- Track workflow metrics: duration, success rate, queue time.
- Monitor deployment success/failure events and alert on anomalies.

## Timeline & Milestones
- **CI pipeline setup**: 3 days.
- **Deployment automation**: 4 days.
- **Observability & documentation**: 3 days.
